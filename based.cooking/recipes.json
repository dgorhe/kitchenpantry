The olive oil is one of the main flavors in this dish and it will taste significantly worse if you cheap out. Herbs, especially rosemary, don't even taste the same when comparing dried to fresh.\n\n## Contribution\n- Tanner Wilcox \u2013 [gitlab](https://git.najer.info/twiclo), [donate](https://twil.cx/donate.txt)\n\n;tags: italian pork roast\n"

        "directions": "\n\n1. The basic rule of thumb I use for pasta is 100g, 1 egg per person\n2. For this recipe you can go two ways, the old school \"well\" method or a kitchen aid mixer (skip to step 7)\n3. For the well method, pile the flour onto the counter and with your hand carve a hole or a well in the center\n4. Crack the eggs into the center of the well, and drizzle a bit of olive oil into the center\n5. With a fork, begin slowly breaking up, mixing, and incorporating the egg into the flour until there is no longer any loose egg that can escape the outer well border\n6. At this point use your hands to bring the sandy mixture together and knead the dough for about 5-10 minutes or until the dough is smooth\n7. For the stand mixer method just throw all the ingredients into the mixer with a dough hook and set it to level 4 for about 3-5 minutes and it will be done\n8. You might need to scrape the sides down and maybe hand knead the dough a bit longer after it's done to make it into a nice smooth ball\n9. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and let it rest in the fridge a bit so it's easier to roll out (15-30 mins) \n10. While the dough is resting, make the filling by first mixing the  ricotta and egg into a bowl\n11. Zest and juice a lemon peel into the bowl\n12. Optionally add seafood ingredients at this point\n13. Grate the Pecorino into the bowl, add salt and pepper to taste, and mix to distribute the ingredients evenly\n14. Take out the dough and cut it into 4 pieces, keeping the ones not currently being worked on covered so they don't dry out\n15. Roll the dough out with a pasta machine down to the point where you can just barely see your hand through it (setting 2-3 out of 7) or roll it out with a rolling pin into a long sheet, maybe like 16 x 8 inches or so\n16. At this point you can either cut the sheet in half and make two sheets, a top and bottom, or one sheet, where you will fold the dough over and use the folded seam as one side of the ravioli \n![Lobster Ravioli](pix/ravioli-02.webp)\n17. Using a teaspoon, evenly space out the ricotta filling onto the sheets, leaving a few inches on each side for the seams\n18. As stated in step 16, either take the 2nd sheet and place it over top or fold over the dough and press down firmly, forcing out any air and making sure the two pieces of dough stick\n19. You may need to brush some water onto the dough if it is too heavily floured and not sticking\n20. Using a fancy pasta cutter, a knife, or even a pizza cutter, cut evenly between the seams of the raviolis to separate them\n21. If you used a pasta cutter, you are now done, store the raviolis on a floured wax paper sheet or freeze them for later\n![Finished Ravioli](pix/ravioli-03.webp)\n22. If you don't have a pasta cutter, use a fork to press down the dough around the edges of the cut raviolis to ensure they are firmly closed and no leaks or air bubbles are visible, or else they will explode when cooked\n23. To cook, throw them in salted boiling water and they will let you know when they're done when they float to the top (1-2 minutes)\n24. Serve the seafood version with a simple fresh red sauce and basil, or spice it up a bit and go with a base of red sauce with some added heavy cream, and a pinch of red pepper flakes to make a pink sauce for the seafood version\n![Served Ravioli](pix/ravioli-04.webp)\n\n## Contribution\n\n- mfed3 - xmr: `48eEMdYtCQaV5wY7wvmxK6jCxKkia9dgpNTMNT1do7RLWXCwWDgSKjN3kiZ6yHbAuAXWgDGN6imnGT9NPeHWD7zX9hSyHu2`\n\n;tags: pasta italian"

Let sit for about 10 minutes, mixture should at least be doubled in size after waiting.\n1. Combine rest of water, yeast mixture, maple syrup (or other sweetener), salt, and flour in a large mixing bowl and stir. The result will be a sticky, rough dough. Use a spoon to stir until well combined and when it can no longer do the job, knead and turn it in the bowl with your hands.\n2. Lift the dough out and lightly grease the bowl with nonstick spray or olive oil. Cover and let rise for 2 hours at room temperature.\n3. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until dough is elastic. Rule of thumb is 10 minutes of kneading.\n4. Place seam-side down in a lightly greased loaf pan or baking sheet. Loosely cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 45-60 minutes.\n5. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C)* toward the end of the dough resting time and place a metal pan (NOT glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack. Also have 1 cup of hot water ready.\n6. When the oven is preheated, slash the bread 2 or 3 times with a knife, making a cut about \u00bd-inch deep.\n7. Place in oven on middle rack. Then carefully pour hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. Expect it to bubble and steam; then close oven door quickly.\n8. Bake the bread for 26 to 35 minutes, or until deep golden brown and risen. Tapping the top of the loaf should produce a hollow sound.\n9. Remove the bread from the oven and let rest in the pan for 5 minutes. Then carefully remove from pan and transfer to a cooling rack to cool. Let it cool completely before slicing for best results (otherwise it can be doughy in the middle).\n10. Store leftovers in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to a few days. Transfer to freezer for longer term storage.\n\n## Notes\n\n* Instant yeast is not recommended as you can't easily tell if the bread will come to life.\n* For whole wheat version use 2 cups of whole wheat bread and 1 and 3/4 cup unbleached all purpose flour.\n* Add sunflower seeds and/or rolled oats for extra flavor/grains.\n* For buns or rolls divide dough into smaller pieces before second rest. Shape them and then let the dough rest. Recommended lowering oven temperature to 350 F and not using water as those will result in a hard crust and potentially dry interior.\n\n## Contribution\n\nAlex Selimov - [Website](https://alexselimov.xyz)\n\n;tags: basic bread fasting\n"

        "directions": "\n\n1. Combine sourdough starter with warm water, break apart and dissolve.\n2. Add flour and mix together gently to hydrate. Mixture will be very wet and sticky.\n3. Once there is no dry flour, let stand for 30 minutes (autolyze).\n4. Add sea salt.\n5. Wet hands and begin to stretch and fold dough to combine salt and to begin gluten formation.\n6. Add drops of water until dough becomes cohesive and supple with no toughness or resistance.\n7. Dough will prove on the counter top for 4 - 5 hours. About every 30 minutes, perform a stretch and fold. This involves grabbing the dough with a wet hand, folding over the top of itself, and repeating this step by turning the bowl and making your way around the dough. It will take some practice to work with a dough of this level of hydration, but will get easier!\n8. You will know fermentation is complete when small bubbles are seen on the surface around the edge of your dough. You can also perform a window pane test by grasping a pinch of dough and pulling it between your fingers. The dough should stretch enough to become see-through. This means enough gluten has formed that the dough is strong enough to hold large air bubbles as it bakes.\n9. Turn onto generously floured surface using a bowl scraper or spatula to protect the dough. Handling the dough gently will prevent deflation.\n10. Shape the dough: Take the two sides and fold them into the center of the wet dough. Then, take the top and bottom and fold them also over the center of the wet dough. Optional: grasp the edge of the dough closest to you and roll dough away from you into a tight loaf shape. Generously flour.\n11. Place into a dish about the size of the dough, a proving basket is ideal. Use a lot of flour in the bowl and on the loaf. The sides of the container should not be shallow, the goal here is to let the bread rest in the shape you want it to bake in.\n12. Refrigerate 12 - 24 hours, the longer the dough rests, the more sour your final product. I don't recommend going over 24 hours but sour dough is fun to experiment with!\n13. Bring dough to room temperature, it should feel like a water balloon, giving resistance to touch with some spring.\n14. Put one oven rack in the center and another below it, place a pan of water on the lower rack. Preheat oven to 475 - 500 degrees F, depending on oven capability. The pan of water should create steam to help the bread expand.\n15. When oven is hot, turn bread into a baking vessel. I use a 8 inch springform pan, but a dutch oven is ideal. You can use any vessel that is rated for high temperatures. If using a dutch oven, keep it covered for the first 15 minutes, and you don't need to use the pan of water.\n16. Flour the top of the loaf and score the bread with a razor blade (this is optional but creates an artisan look)\n17. Bake covered/steamed for 15 minutes, then reduce oven temperature to 425 F. If using steam, remove the water pan now.\n18. Bake for another 25 - 30 minutes until crust is a rusty color and sounds hollow when tapped.\n19. Let bread cool completely before slicing. (if you can wait!)\n\n## Contribution\n\n- Quinn & Alison\n\n;tags: bread sourdough\n"

        "directions": "\n\n### Preparing the fish\n\n1. Turn the creature on its back. With a sharp and preferably short-bladed knife make an incision from the anus to just between the two small fins under the head. This is best done by inserting the knife blade tip facing up while putting force upwards and moving towards the head, letting gravity do the work. This helps to avoid puncturing the organs.\n2. Remove the organs. Gently pull and cut the membrane that connects each to the rest of the body.\n3. Make an incision around the mouth (the hard 'lips'), turn the fish around and do the same to that side.\n4. Start to slowly but firmly pull back the skin cutting whenever there is resistance as you make your way towards the tail.\n5. Once you have removed the skin, flip it back onto its back and cut off the thin flabs of meat of its underside and fins from the body. At this point there should be a clear distinction between the body and the larger head. Behead the animal.\n6. With a filleting knife, fillet the meat from the backbone and remove the tail.\n7. You should be left with 2 long strips of meat. Cut each in half.\n\n### Cooking\n\n8. In a pan on medium heat, melt a good amount of butter and place the fillets inside. The goal here is to sear the meat to get that light crust. Flip until all sides have turned the 'golden brown' color.\n9. Add the herbs, just enough to cover the fillets, salt and pepper too if desired and cover with the lid on low heat until fully cooked. Time here varies but it can be anywhere between 5-10 minutes.\n10. Enjoy. This goes well with steamed vegetables. Or potatoes to soak up the butter.\n\n![served](pix/fried-anglerfish-fillet-01.webp)\n\n## Contribution\n\nShou, [website](https://shouganai.xyz)\n\n;tags: fish seafood\n"

Now wash your hands with soap to remove excess olive oil.\n5. Top generously with cinnamon and salt. Pepper and/or rosemary may be added for additional flavor if desired.\n6. Put in preheated oven. Setting timer for 20 minutes.\n7. At 20 minutes, flip the fries. Rubber tongs make it easy to grab and turn a lot.\n8. Return to oven setting timer for another 10-20 minutes depending on quality of the oven and desired crispiness.\n9. Enjoy. Maybe them put in a glass bowl.\n\n## Notes\n\n* A fast method to cut the the sweet pototoes is first into fourths, slice the fourths, chops the sliced layers while stacked into fries.\n* If you want to experiment with a variety of fats, consider combining the olive oil with grass-fed butter and coconut oil. I believe the issue with coconut oil is it likes being cooked at lower temperatures or else the health quality of the oil will degrade.\n\n## Contribution\n\nShane Kunz - [Website](https://shanekunz.com)\n\n;tags: potato snack side fasting\n"

Add beef bouillon cubes, diced beef, fish/oyster sauce, and honey/sugar, then simmer for a couple hours with the lid on.\n4. Cook the rice noodles (should only take a few minutes, just until the texture is al dente enough).\n5. Once the broth is done cooking, fish out the spices that you added at step 2. It's worth doing this rather than accidentally chewing on a bit of star anise, trust me.\n6. Cut up coriander and spring onions as garnish.\n7. Add rice noodles to bowl, followed by the broth and its contents, followed by the garnish. This can be made and eaten within 1 hour if you want it quickly, but typically with broths the longer you simmer the tastier it'll be.\n\n## Contribution\n\n- Jon Burga - [website](https://jonburga.com),\n[donate-btc]( `bc1qqsj592ls8xdhxpf5h4e8wj2w3v9uvv6mc6gz7f`)\n\n;tags: vietnamese beef\n"

He was too proud to beg for a bite to eat, so instead, he requested a large pot in which he could make \u201ca delicious and filling\u2026\u2026.stone soup\u201d. With arched eyebrows and curious glances, the family invited him into their home and set up a large pot over flickering flames and filled with water. Slowly walking up to the ironclad cauldron, the friar reached into his deep pocket to produce a smooth and well-cleaned stone that he promptly dropped into the boiling water. A little while later he tasted the soup and said that it needed a touch of seasoning. So the wife brought him some salt to add, to which he suggested that maybe a little bit of chouri\u00e7o (sausage), or pork belly, would be better. Graciously, she obliged and dropped several thick slices into the pot. Then, the friar asked if she might not have a little something to enrich the soup, such as potatoes or beans from a previous meal. With a broad smile, she agreed, and added a healthy portion into the bubbling water. This banter continued back and forth between the family and the friar before he finally announced that he had indeed made a very delicious and filling soup. When the soup was done, the friar fished the stone out of the pot, washed and dried it off, and plopped it back in his pocket for the next time.\n> - According to the people of Almeirim\n\n## Contribution\n\n- Artur Mancha -- [Pleroma](https://pleroma.pt/@lisbonjoker)\n\n;tags: portuguese soup pork\n"

        "directions": "\n\n1. If you don't have cooked potatoes from the day before: Cook them and let them cool. It is important to use cold potatoes. You can also use raw potatoes. The cooking time will increase though.\n2. Shred your potatoes with a grater. The shreds should be quite large so don't use your typical cheese shredder.\n3. Dice the first onion and mix together with potatoes. You can also add diced bacon if you want to. Add your seasonings here.\n4. Heat up some butter in a large pan. Add your mix to the pan on high heat. Let the mixture get warm for a few minutes under constant stirring.\n5. Reduce heat to medium-high. Form the R\u00f6sti into a round puck. It should fill out the whole pan. I recommend a thickness of around 1 - 1.5cm (~1/2\") for a softer R\u00f6sti.\n6. Add some more butter flakes around the inside of the pan to get it under the R\u00f6sti.\n7. It can take quite a while for a nice crust to form. Check after roughly 5-10 minutes for browning.\n8. While the R\u00f6sti is cooking dice the other onion and the carrots. Steam everything in a pan with a bit of water. Use a lid to get the temperature up.\n9. Alternatively you can use fresh or creamed spinach.\n10. When you're satisfied with the browning, flip the R\u00f6sti and set the heat to medium-low. A plate can be useful here to put on top of the R\u00f6sti in the pan.\n11. When the R\u00f6sti crispness is to your liking, remove from pan and fry two eggs. A runny yolk adds quite a bit to the potatoes.\n12. Top R\u00f6sti with eggs and serve with the peas or spinach.\n\n## Contributors\n\n- **Alexander Bocken** -- [contact](mailto:alexander@bocken.org)\n- **Elias Pahls** -- [contact](mailto:pahlse@pm.me)\n\n;tags: swiss potato side cheesefare\n"

Optionally you can now brush on the egg wash to make the crust get a shiny golden brown color when it cooks\n14. Cut a few slits in the top crust with a knife to give it a nice design and allow for air to release\n15.

You can now use the starter for baking sourdough bread. Remember to not use all the starter at once and feed the remaining starter to always have it available.\n5. Storing the starter: store the starter in a closed container or jar in the fridge. The starter will survive almost indefinitely. After some time a vinegarish liquid forms on top of the starter. Don't be afraid of this, it is there to protect the starter from microbes. It can be poured away when you use the starter next time.\n6. When using the starter after long storage you need to activate it again. Feed it 1-2 times and see if bubbles form. You can also test the activity by placing small part into a glass of water. An active starter will float.\n\n## Contribution\n\n- Vili Kangas\n\n;tags: bread sourdough basic\n"

Make sure the chicken is cooked all the way through and serve.\n\n## Contribution\n\n- Luke Goule - [GitHub](https://github.com/LukeGoule), [XMR Donation QR](https://ergine.cc/xmr.png)\n\n;tags: curry chicken\n"

Mince the chicken, if necessary. Mince the onions, if you desire them. Divide butter, once softened, into medium bits.\n6. Add eggs to the meat and put a few into a medium bowl; mix both bowls' contents thoroughly.\n7. Add the spices, salt and/or sauce of your choosing. Some may consider this barbaric, but I found that Heinz's mustard ketchup works exceptionally well with the recipe. They'll come out a tad red, though.\n8. Add the softened-up butter to the XL bowl and mix thoroughly.\n9. MAKE A TEST CUTLET by rolling up a small ball of the mince, then dipping it into the bread, then into the eggs, then into the bread again, compounding the breading slightly between dips. More dips means less leaked butter/juice, but don't overdo it lest you want more bread than meat in your cutlet.\n10. Fry, let cool and then taste the cutlet. (Pozharskiye are very juicy, so liquid in the pan is to be expected.)\n11. If unsatisfied, add more flavoring or throw everything away. If satisfied, repeat step 9. (Most cutlet sizes work well. Haven't tried making giant or tiny ones, though.)\n\n## Contribution\n\nDick, with love from the Motherland.\n\n;tags: russian chicken\n"

        "directions": "\n\n1. Drain and rinse the garbanzo beans.\n2. Place garbanzo beans in a small saucepan or pot, add 1 teaspoon baking soda (this alters the pH to encourage the beans to break down and shed their skins), and cover with a few inches of water. Bring to a boil and cook for 20 minutes, until the skins begin to fall off and the beans look overcooked/mushy. You may need to reduce the heat after a few minutes to prevent boil-overs.\n3. While the garbanzo beans are boiling, combine the garlic and lemon juice with 1/4 teaspoon salt in the workbowl of your food processor. Pulse until a fine, uniform consistency is achieved. You may need to scrape down the top and sides of the bowl to ensure the garlic is chopped finely enough. Leave the mixture for at least 10 minutes for the raw garlic taste to mellow.\n4. After 20 minutes of boiling, drain the garbanzo beans and their skins in a mesh strainer, then rinse for at least 30 seconds with cold water to remove any lingering taste from the baking soda.\n5. Add the tahini to the food processor. Blend until creamy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.\n6. While the food processor is running on \"high,\" slowly drizzle in two tablespoons of ice-cold water. Continue to run on high, scraping down the bowl as necessary (1-3 times), until the mixture has enough air worked into it that it lightens in color and thickens in texture substantially.\n7. Scrape down the bowl again, then add the garbanzo beans and cumin (and za'atar, if you have it). Pulse a few times, then set the food processor to high again. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon of olive oil, as slowly as you can manage.\n8. Continue to process the hummus on high for at least one minute longer, up to three minutes longer if it hasn't become smooth enough yet. You can make the hummus thinner at this point by slowly adding ice water a teaspoon at a time while processing on high. Taste the hummus at this point to determine if it needs more lemon juice or more salt for flavor.\n9. Transfer the hummus into a serving bowl and smooth out the surface with the back of a spoon, creating swirls or indentations for olive oil as desired. Top with additional olive oil and optionally finely chopped fresh parsley, more za'atar, or a sprinkling of sumac (a spice mixture) or dukkah (a seed mixture).\n10. Serve immediately or transfer to an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to one week.\n\n## Contribution\n\n- Jacob Smith - [website](https://jacobwsmith.xyz)\n- K Chesney (revision)\n\n;tags: basic snack spread fasting\n"

Browning the meat on the outside will give it a much nicer texture when you go to eat this and **should not be skipped for convenience**.\n3. Remove the meat and add in the vegetables. Adding some salt will help remove the moisture in the veg and will help deglaze the caramelised bits at the bottom of the pot.\n4. (Optional) If you have a Guinness or some other stout add the meat back in an deglaze with about a third of the can. This will add some extra flavour. Wait until the alcohol has completely evaporated until you stir or continue.\n5. Add back in the meat and add in the stock and herbs. Lower the heat and allow to simmer for about 2 - 2.5 hours.\n6. After 2 hours the stew will be a bit thicker but probably still watery. The easiest thing to do is add some cut up potatoes for the last half hour. The starch will help thicken the stew considerably.

Begin adding the beef strips and let them cook, stirring to prevent sticking or unequal cooking.\n6. Meanwhile, heat up a pot of highly salted water until it boils. Then add the egg noodles. Do not cook for too long as egg noodles might begin disintegrating when overcooked.\n7. Once beef is cooked, pour off the liquid produced from the meat.\n8. Add the chicken stock to the pan and continue cooking.\n9. Make roux (by mixing a small amount of flour with either water or melted butter). Mix this into the beef and stock as it cooks to thicken it to the desired consistency.\n10. Add Worchestershire sauce and the dijon mustard to taste.\n11. Serve on a plate with a scoop of egg noodles covered with the beef sauce.\n\n## Contribution\n\n- Luke Smith -- [website](https://lukesmith.xyz), [donate](https://lukesmith.xyz/donate)\n\n;tags: american beef\n"

Fry the preferred pork (Guanciale or Smoked Pancetta) in a iron or nonstick pan (if using a different kind of pan add a dash of extra virgin olive oil) on low to medium heat until the sides are crisp but the insides are chewy.\n4. While everything is being cooked and fried, beat the eggs manually using a fork until everything is entirely liquid. Remember to watch the time.\n5. When your pasta is done (-1 minute), drain it and put it in the bowl with eggs. At this step you may consider the timing: if the pasta is too hot you will cook the eggs, and some people don't like it this way, so just wait for a minute. Keep moving and stirring to fully incorporate the eggs. Add guanciale and as many fats remaining in the pan as you want. Keep moving and stirring.\n6. Plate and optionally garnish with the preferred grated cheese and black pepper. Voila.\n\n## Contribution\n\nPeter Piontek, Ladislao Blanchi\n\n;tags: italian pasta quick cheesefare\n"

During this resting time, you are going to add your Nashville Hot Chicken seasoning together with 1 1/2 cups of the cooking oil you just used. It will simmer but quickly whisk until it comes still. Now you want to brush that amazing sauce all over the crispy chicken or dunk it. \n6. Have some toasted buns ready and create your sandwich.
