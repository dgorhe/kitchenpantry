# How to get started
You should always start by cloning and then pulling the main branch. If you can't find what you're looking for in the main branch, check out a different branch (we'll talk about new branches later). If you're really unsure how to use git, make a repo and try to complete the following tasks:

- Create a repository on GitHub making sure to select the "include README.md" option and change the README.md file via GitHub
- Create a repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine 
- Create a repository on your local machine and get it set up on GitHub
- Create a repository on GitHub, clone it to your local machine, change a file, commit the changes, and push the changes to GitHub
- Add more complicated stuff later

If you get stuck on these tasks, Google it first, but feel free to ask questions. You're also encouraged to ask questions if you find a command to do something but are unsure how or why it works.
